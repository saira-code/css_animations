# CSS Button Animation

This project contains a simple CSS animation for a button that bounces when you hover over it.

## What I Learned

While making this app, I learned how to create smooth animations using only CSS, specifically using the `transform` and `transition` properties.

## Favorite Feature

I enjoyed building the hover bounce effect the most because it adds a nice interactive feel to a simple button.

## Future Improvements

If I had more time, I would add more complex animations like color changes and maybe sound effects on hover or click.
