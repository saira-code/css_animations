# CSS Button Animations

This project contains a simple CSS animation for a button that bounces when you hover over it.

## What I Learned

While making this app, I learned how to create smooth animations using only CSS, specifically using the `transform` and `transition` properties.

## Favorite Feature

I enjoyed building the hover bounce effect the most because it adds a nice interactive feel to a simple button.

## Future Improvements

If I had more time, I would add more complex animations like color changes and maybe sound effects on hover or click.




# Hover Dover CSS Animation
This repository contains a simple CSS hover animation project called **Hover Dover**.

## What did you learn while making this app?
I learned how to create smooth and visually appealing hover animations using CSS transitions and keyframes. I also practiced structuring my files and using Git/GitHub for version control and collaboration.

## What feature did you enjoy building the most?
I enjoyed building the hover effect that changes the button's color and shape dynamically. Seeing the animation come alive with just CSS was really satisfying!

## What would you add next if you had more time?
If I had more time, I would add JavaScript interactivity to make the animations respond to different user actions and add accessibility improvements for keyboard and screen reader users.

## Demo Video
I have included a short demo video showing the animation in action:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ism_MiA5JwPF1wUgLAPTPJb782jqksbl/view?usp=drive_link
